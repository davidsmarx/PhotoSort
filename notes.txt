1. open anaconda prompt
2. cd C:\Users\dsmar\Documents\Python Scripts\PhotoSort
3. > start emacs
emacs starts but working dir is emacs/bin. Need to figure out how to make working dir
4. in emacs, load test_script.py
5. M-x shell
command line inherits path from the Anaconda shell, so python, etc works
If you open emacs directly, not through from the anaconda shell, the command line does not have python in the path.
